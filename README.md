## 🤖 Machine-Readable Data / AI Agents

[`data.json`](./skills/data.json) — the full skill set as structured JSON (definitions, principles, palettes, typography, combinations, anti-patterns, tags). The root [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md) also serves as a router for AI agents to identify the right style and drill into the appropriate guide.

```json
{
  "styles": [{
    "id": "neumorphism",
    "sections": {
      "palette": [{ "role": "...", "hex": "#..." }],
      "combinations": { "good": [...], "caution": [...], "avoid": [...] },
      "antiPatterns": ["..."]
    }
  }]
}
```

## 🖼 References & Inspiration

[`assets/figma-references.md`](./skills/assets/figma-references.md) — curated Figma Community search links, real-world reference sites, stock asset sources, and quick-start CSS tokens for each style.

## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Select a style:** use the summary table to choose the skill that fits your product/brand.
2. **Read SKILL.md:** each file follows 8 standard sections (definition → principles → colors → font → visual → applications → combinations → anti-patterns).
3. **Apply:** use the hex palette + font pair + visual rules as standards when designing. For AI agents: use the root `SKILL.md` router to select a style, then the appropriate `SKILL.md` guide for detailed implementation.

## 🤖 AI Agent Usage

The root [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md) acts as a skill router — it describes all 12 styles, their ideal use cases, and links to individual guides. Load it when the task involves UI/UX design, style selection, or design review. Each style's `SKILL.md` file follows an 8-section standard.
